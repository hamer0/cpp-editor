# Variables
## Keep track of data that changes

Variables are used to store data that may change, such as the number of points you have in a game. Variables can have different data types.

### Declaring variables
Declare a new variable with a *type* and *variable name*. Set an initial value using the `=` sign:

Select type:
#### int
Declare an integer (whole number) with the `int` keyword
```
int count = 0;
```

#### char
Declare a character with the `char` keyword
```
char letter = 'a';
```
